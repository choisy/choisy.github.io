<p>Very often I remember the name of the R function I need to use for a particular
problem but I don’t quite remember how to use it exactly… And, even worse,
what I remember is that last time I had to use this function it took me a long
time to figure out how to use it… Since I’m not ready to go through that
learning process again, I decide to look for the R script on my computer that
did make use of this function. And here comes the power of <code>bash</code>! (if you have
bash on your computer, of course…). Well, to be more precise, I actually
refering to the particular <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code> commands here that can be used in
<code>bash</code> of course (if you’re on linux or macos), but also in any other UNIX-type
shell. Let’s demonstrate its power, using my specific example.</p>
<p>The R function I wanted to use was <code>sf::st_simplify()</code>. I knew I used it
recently (in the last 2 months) in an Rmarkdown file, but I couldn’t remember
which one. Looking for all the Rmarkdown files in the current file hierarchy is
done by</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>find ~/Dropbox/aaa -name &quot;*.Rmd&quot; -mtime -10w -type f</code></pre>
<p>The <code>find</code> command is followed by the path of the location where we want to
start the file search (here <code>~/Dropbox/aaa</code>). Then it is followed by a number of
options specified by pairs of options names (preceded by the <code>-</code> sign) followed
by the option value. For example, here <code>-name "*.Rmd"</code> specifies that we are
looking for files with names ending with the <code>.Rmd</code> extension, <code>-mtime -10w</code>
means that we are looking at files that were modified less than 10 weeks ago and
<code>-type f</code> means that we are looking at regular files (excluding directories,
links, etc…). If we had been interested in file that were modified more than
3 months ago instead of less than 10 weeks ago, that would have been specified
by <code>-mtime +3m</code>. Among these options, one is particularly amazing in the sense
that it allows to run another command on the files that were selected. This
option is <code>-exec</code> and is followed by the command we want to run. For example,
here, I want to search for the <code>st_simplify</code> pattern in the selected files:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>find ~/Dropbox/aaa -name &quot;*.Rmd&quot; -mtime -10w -type f -exec grep -n &quot;st_simplify&quot; {} \;</code></pre>
<p>Here it says that, on each of the files that were selected by the first part of
the <code>find</code> command (this files are here specified by the <code>{}</code> placeholder), we
want to execute the <code>grep</code> command (with the -n option in order to also print
the line number where the pattern was found in the file). Don’t forget here the
<code>\;</code> sign that closes the value of the <code>-exec</code> option. Indeed, contrary to the
other options of the <code>find</code> command that have, as a value, only one “word” (i.e.
character string without any space), the <code>-exec</code> may have (and typically have)
many words as its value. Thus, the value of the <code>-exec</code> command is all the words
that are between <code>exec</code> and <code>\;</code>. Adding the <code>-print</code> option (no value) will have
the effect to print the name of the file where the pattern was found:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>find ~/Dropbox/aaa -name &quot;*.Rmd&quot; -mtime -10w -type f -exec grep -n &quot;st_simplify&quot; {} \; -print</code></pre>
<p>And here it is!</p>
