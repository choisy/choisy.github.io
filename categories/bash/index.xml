      <description>Very often I remember the name of the R function I need to use for a particular problem but I don’t quite remember how to use it exactly… And, even worse, what I remember is that last time I had to use this function it took me a long time to figure out how to use it… Since I’m not ready to go through that learning process again, I decide to look for the R script on my computer that did make use of this function.</description>
