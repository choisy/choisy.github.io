      <description>Weather variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, etcâ€¦ are collected from climatic stations. These data are thus available from points in space whereas we often need them to be representative of administrative units (e.g. provinces) which are polygons. A strategy to transform points data into polygons data is to perform interpolation of points data onto a grid and then aggregation of grid data into polygons, as illustrated on the figure below:</description>

For that we need spatial data in raster format. These data can be qualitative (e.</description>
