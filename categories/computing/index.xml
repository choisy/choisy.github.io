      <description>Weather variables such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc… are collected from climatic stations. These data are thus available from points in space whereas we often need them to be representative of administrative units (e.g. provinces) which are polygons. A strategy to transform points data into polygons data is to perform interpolation of points data onto a grid and then aggregation of grid data into polygons, as illustrated on the figure below:</description>

      <description>Parallel version of replicate with parallel Loading the package:
&amp;gt; library(parallel) of which we’ll use the 6 following functions:
 detectCores which detects the number of CPU cores; makeCluster which creates a cluster of a given number of cores; clusterEvalQ which evaluates a literal expression on each cluster node. It is a parallel version of evalq. clusterExport which assigns the values on the master R process of the variables named in its named list argument to variables of the same names in the global environment (aka workspace) of each node; parSapply parallel version of sapply.</description>
